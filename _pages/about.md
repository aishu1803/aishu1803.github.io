I am systems and computational neuroscientist with an interest in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying cognition. Specifically, I am interested in disentangling cortical mechanisms that encode relevant information leading to flexible behavior. With the advent of new technologies that allow us to monitor activity from hundreds of neurons simultaneously, I believe we now have an unique opportunity to understand how populations of neurons work together to achieve intended behavior. During my PhD, I studied how population of neurons in dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex of non-human primates encode working memory, an integral component of our cognition. Currently, I am working on understanding neuronal populations in the cortico-striatal circuit during decision making involving action control. During my time as an academic, I'd like to understand cortical contribution to flexible behavior.
